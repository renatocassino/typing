The Emu War, also called the Great Emu War, was a military operation in Australia in many years ago. Emus are large birds that cannot fly. Wild emus only live in Australia. The Australian army killed many emus because the farmers thought they were pests. Farmers were having trouble with the many emus invading the Campion district of Western Australia. Soldiers tried to kill emus with Lewis guns. The media called the military action against birds the Emu War. The army did kill some birds. However, there were still many emus and they continued to destroy crops.
